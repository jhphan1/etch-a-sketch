# etch-a-sketch
This project was great for utilizing everything I learned about DOM manipulation and event handlers to create a very responsive user interface. Some challenges I faced were acclimating to the syntax of callback functions and anonymous arrow functions as well as remembering to remove prior event handlers so that the drawing effects do not overlap.

Completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
